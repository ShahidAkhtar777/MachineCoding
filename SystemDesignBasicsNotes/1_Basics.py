# While creating a large system we need to consider few things --
# 1. What architectural pieces can we use ?
# 2. How these pieces will interact with each other ?
# 3. How we can make the best use of these pieces ? what are the right tradeoffs ?

# Key characteristics of distributed system are scalability, reliability, availability, efficiency
# and manageability

# Scalability:
# Scalability is the capability of the system, process or network to grow and manage increased demand,
# without any loss in performance.
