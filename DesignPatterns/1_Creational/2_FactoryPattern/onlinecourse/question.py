"""
You are tasked with designing a Course Management System for an online learning platform.
The system should manage various types of courses, each consisting of multiple modules.
The courses offered include Python, Java, and JavaScript, each with specific modules tailored to their content.
The system should also allow for the creation of new modules.

To ensure a scalable and maintainable design, use the Factory Design Pattern.
The system should have the following requirements:

    Course and Module Management:
        Each course should have a name, duration, and difficulty level.
        Each course should consist of multiple modules.
        Each module should have a title and content.
    Factories:
        Use factories to create courses and modules.
        Implement an abstract factory to define the interface for creating courses and modules.
        Implement concrete factories for creating specific courses (Python, Java, JavaScript).
    Structure Your Solution:
        Split the implementation into different files and folders for better organization and clarity.
        Follow a directory structure that separates concerns logically.
